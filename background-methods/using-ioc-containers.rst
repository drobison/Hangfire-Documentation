Using IoC containers
=====================

As I said in the :doc:`previous section <passing-dependencies>` Hangfire uses the ``JobActivator`` class to instantiate the target types before invoking instance methods. You can override its behavior to perform more complex logic on a type instantiation. For example, you can tell it to use IoC container that is used in your project:

.. code-block:: c#

   public class ContainerJobActivator : JobActivator
   {
       private IContainer _container;

       public ContainerJobActivator(IContainer container)
       {
           _container = container;
       }

       public override object ActivateJob(Type type)
       {
           return _container.Resolve(type);
       }
   }

Then, you need to register it as a current job activator before starting the Hangfire server:

.. code-block:: c#

   // Somewhere in bootstrap logic, for example in the Global.asax.cs file
   var container = new Container();
   GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseActivator(new ContainerJobActivator(container));
   ...
   app.UseHangfireServer();

To simplify the initial installation, there are some integration  packages already available on NuGet:

* `Hangfire.Autofac <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.Autofac/>`_
* `Hangfire.Ninject <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.Ninject/>`_
* `Hangfire.SimpleInjector <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.SimpleInjector/>`_
* `Hangfire.Unity <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.Unity/>`_
* `Hangfire.Windsor <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.Windsor/>`_


Some of these activators also provide an extension method for the ``GlobalConfiguration`` class:

.. code-block:: c#

   GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseNinjectActivator(kernel);

.. admonition:: ``HttpContext`` is not available
   :class: warning
   
   Request information is not available during the instantiation of a target type. If you register your dependencies in a request scope (``InstancePerHttpRequest`` in Autofac, ``InRequestScope`` in Ninject and so on), an exception will be thrown during the job activation process.

So, **the entire dependency graph should be available**. Either register additional services without using the request scope, or use separate instance of container if your IoC container does not support dependency registrations for multiple scopes.
